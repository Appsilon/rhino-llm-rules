# Custom LLM Rules for Rhino Development by Appsilon

This repository contains custom rules for [GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-repository-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot?tool=vscode) and [Cursor](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules-for-ai) code editor, specifically tailored for developing applications with [Rhino](https://appsilon.github.io/rhino/) framework.

## Usage

### GitHub Copilot

Copy `.github/copilot-instructions.md` into your project. For more details on how to set up GitHub Copilot, refer to the [GitHub Copilot documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/getting-started-with-github-copilot) and the [Copilot instructions guide](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-repository-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot?tool=vscode).

### Cursor

Copy `.cursor/rules` into your project. For more information on configuring Cursor, please check the [Cursor documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/getting-started) and the [Cursor rules guide](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules-for-ai).

## Contributing

You are more than welcome to propose improvements and new rules that will help using LLM tools in Rhino.
To do so, create a PR with your additions to the ruleset.

## What's next?

Once matured, we plan to include the rules as a part of Rhino setup.
