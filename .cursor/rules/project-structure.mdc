## Project Structure

Rhino enforces a specific structure for robust and maintainable R Shiny applications:

- `app.R`: The entry point recognized by RStudio. Do not modify this file.
- `app/main.R`: The true application entry point where top-level UI and server are defined.
- `app/logic/`: Contains application code independent from Shiny (data processing, external connections, etc.).
- `app/view/`: Contains Shiny modules and UI code that depends on Shiny's reactive capabilities.
- `app/static/`: Contains static assets (CSS, JavaScript, images).
- `app/styles`: Contains SASS SCSS for styling the application.
- `app/js`: Contains JavaScript files for client-side functionality.
- `tests/testthat/`: Contains unit tests.

### Key Principles
- Place code that can be expressed without Shiny in the `logic` directory.
- Place code that relies on reactivity or UI components in the `view` directory.
- Use Shiny modules to isolate paired UI/Server code and prevent reactivity overlap.
